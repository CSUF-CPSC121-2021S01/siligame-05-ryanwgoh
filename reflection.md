# Milestone 2

## Description
In this milestone, I made it so the player and opponent can launch projectiles, opponents respawn when there are none left, made
a counter that keeps track of the score, and print out a game over screen when the player dies.
## Challenges encountered
The challenges I encountered was changing my code so it works with unique_ptrs rather than just classes.
## Things I've learned
The most important thing I learned was how to effectively use unique_ptrs and some of it's unique functions like std::move
